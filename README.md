# NestJS Channel Socket Example Project

> **Greetings!** ðŸ‘‹
>
> Are you searching for an example of a NestJS socket project? Or are you seeking new strategies for your own project?
>
> You're in the right place. This project serves as an illustrative example of a channel application. Users can create
> channels, join and leave them, send messages to channels, and receive messages. The project also handles the scenario
> of saving messages when a user is offline, and subsequently sending these messages to the user upon reconnection.
>
> In this repository, you will discover:
