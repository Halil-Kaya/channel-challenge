# NestJS Channel Socket Example Project

> **Greetings!** ðŸ‘‹
>
> Are you searching for an example of a NestJS socket project? Or are you seeking new strategies for your own project?
>
> You're in the right place. This project serves as an illustrative example of a channel application. Users can create
> channels, join and leave them, send messages to channels, and receive messages. The project also handles the scenario
> of saving messages when a user is offline, and subsequently sending these messages to the user upon reconnection.

## Sending and handling rabbitMQ events

---
> if you want to send event and handle it you can use my EventPublisher class
> 
#### example of sending message 

```ts
this.eventPublisher.publishToBroadcast<ChannelSendMessageBroadcastEvent>(
    ChannelMessageBroadcast.CHANNEL_MESSAGE_SEND,
    {
        client,
        reqId,
        payload: {
            message: messageAck
        }
    }
);
```

### example of receiveng message


```ts
@RabbitmqQueueuHandler(ChannelMessageBroadcast.CHANNEL_MESSAGE_SEND)
async handleChannelMessageSend({ payload, client, reqId }: BroadcastEvent<ChannelSendMessageBroadcastEvent>){
    const { message } = payload;
    //...
